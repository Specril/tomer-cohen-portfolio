## 📌 Overview
Hey, I’m Tomer! 👋

I built this portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and everything I’m passionate about as a developer. Whether it’s web development, data science, machine learning, or game development, I love working on challenging and creative projects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
I built this site using React and JavaScript, with CSS for styling to keep things clean and responsive. I’m hosting it on GitHub Pages, making it easy to update as I grow and take on new projects.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here
* About Me – A little background on who I am and what I love to build.
* Projects – A collection of the things I’ve worked on, including descriptions, tech stacks, and links to my repositories.
* Contact – If you want to reach out, I’d love to chat!

This portfolio is a work in progress—just like me. I’m always learning and improving, and I’m excited about where this journey takes me next! 🚀
